}
\arguments{
\item{address_location}{A \code{\link[sf]{sf}} object representing the location of interest, the location should be in projected coordinates.}

\item{canopy_layer}{A \code{\link[sf]{sf}} that represents a canopy, the layer should be in projected coordinates}

\item{buffer_distance}{A distance in meters to create a buffer or isochrone around the address location}

\item{avgcanopyRedii}{Optional; A distance in meters to create a buffer around each tree points, useful in case there is no canopy polygon layer and no canopy radius information}

\item{network_buffer}{Optional; a  logical, the default is an euclidean buffer, when TRUE, a network buffer will be used.}

\item{network_file}{Optional; a \code{\link[sfnetworks]{sfnetwork}} object representing a road network, If missing the road network will be created.}

\item{epsg_code}{Optional; a epsg code to get a Projected CRS in the final output, If missing, the default is \code{3395}}

\item{folder_path_network}{Optional; a Folder path to where the retrieved network should be saved continuously. Must not include a filename extension (e.g. '.shp', '.gpkg').}

\item{folder_path_osmtrees}{Optional; a Folder path to where the retrieved OSM tree points will be saved continuously. Must not include a filename extension (e.g. '.shp', '.gpkg').}

\item{UID}{Optional; a character string representing a unique identifier for each point of interest}

\item{address_location_neighborhood}{Optional; a logical, indicating whether to calculate with an address point or a neighbourhood. default is \code{FALSE}}

\item{speed}{Optional; a  numeric value representing the speed in km/h to calculate the buffer distance (required if \code{time} is provided)}

\item{time}{Optional; a  numeric value representing the travel time in minutes to calculate the buffer distance (required if \code{speed} is provided)}

\item{city}{Optional; a when using a network buffer, you can add a city where your address points are to speed up the process}
}

# calculate the canopy percentage for the POIs with default settings
